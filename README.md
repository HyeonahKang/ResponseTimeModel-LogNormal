# Joint Estimation of the Three-Parameter Logistic Item-Response Model and the Log-Normal Response-Time Model

- mmap: estimates item parameters jointly under 3PLM and LNM via marginal maximum a posteriori
- mmap_fsb: subroutine for mmap that performs Fisher's scoring
- map: estimates person parameters jointly under 3PLM and LNM via maximum a posteriori
